# Breadcrumbs.nvim

Problem: With ADHD, losing track of the cursor is like walking through a doorway and forgetting what I was doing in the first place.

Solution: Most helpful to me (and almost completely eliminating my problem with this) is this plugin that leaves a "breadcrumb trail" of where my cursor's been.
